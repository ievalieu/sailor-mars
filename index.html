			<p>Dearest Mentee,</p>
			<br>
			<p>I still remember the first time meeting you during a CKI social. I instantly dubbed you as Mars and made a sailor moon reference towards Sailor Mars that will forever haunt you. Please refer to above picture of our Sailor Family. Hope you like my rushed job of a website I made for you from scratch!</p>
